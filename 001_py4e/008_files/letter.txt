This is a little bit of a hack, but it works.
Dear god, this is so ugly.
I'd like to see a world where people would just say, "I'm sorry, but I can't do that."
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
With all due respect, I'd like to say that I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
At the very least, I'd like to say that I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
Warmest regards,

P.S. I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
