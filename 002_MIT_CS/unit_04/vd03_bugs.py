# Once you find your code doesn't work
# Isolate the bugs.
# Fix them
# Retest

# The first bug was a literal bug (a motherfucking literal bug) that was
# causing the program to crash. A moth. Grace Hopper.
# The second bug was a logic bug that was causing the program to crash.
# The third bug was a logic bug that was causing the program to crash.
# The fourth bug was a logic bug that was causing the program to crash.
# The fifth bug was a logic bug that was causing the program to crash.
# The sixth bug was a logic bug that was causing the program to crash.
# The seventh bug was a logic bug that was causing the program to crash.
# The eighth bug was a logic bug that was causing the program to crash.

# Where do digital computer bugs come from.
# There are overt bugs and covert bugs.
# Overt bugs are bugs that are visible to the user.
# Covert bugs are bugs that are not visible to the user.

# There are overt/persistent bugs and transient/covert (or intermittent) bugs.
# Persistent bugs are much easier to fix than transient bugs.
