# Exercise 4.7.2

# Consider the following code:

def union(set1, set2):
   """
   set1 and set2 are collections of objects, each of which might be empty.
   Each set has no duplicates within itself, but there may be objects that
   are in both sets. Objects are assumed to be of the same type.

   This function returns one set containing all elements from
   both input sets, but with no duplicates.
   """
   pass

# You would want to test with both empty sets, either set being full 
# or empty, and with one set containing all the elements of the other.
# You would also want to test with one set containing a subset of the
# elements of the other.
