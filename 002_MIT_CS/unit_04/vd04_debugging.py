# Debugging has a steep learning curve.

# Be patient.
# There are tools to help you debug.
# They are called debugging tools.

# also use lots of print statements.


# Look into python tutor.

# Weird!

# move print statement through the code to find where it jams up.

# IndexError: list index out of range
# TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
# ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1'
# ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
# NameError: name 'x' is not defined
# SyntaxError: invalid syntax (missing parenthesis)
# AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'y'
# KeyError: 'key'
# AssertionError: assert False
# RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
# RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded
# EOFError: unexpected EOF while parsing
# ImportError: No module named 'x'
# IndentationError: unexpected indent
# TabError: unexpected indent with tabs
# SystemError: (IOError) [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'x'

# Logic errors are harder. Thinking and planning is key. Draw it out on paper.
# Think about the problem.
# Think about the steps.
# Think about the results.
# Explain the code. Say it out loud. Explain it to the duck.
# Explain the code to the duck.
# Explain the code to the human.
# Take a break.

# Write modules at a time test and repeat.
# Then write integration tests.
