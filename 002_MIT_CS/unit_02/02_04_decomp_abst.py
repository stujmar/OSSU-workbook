# What ahave we been doing so far?

# Good programmer is not measured by the amount of code but the functionality of it.

# Decomposition/Modulization

# Abstractions 
# Abstraction is a process of taking a set of related objects and making it easier to use.
# A black box with an interface.

# Decomposition breaking a problem up into smaller parts.

# Divide it up into delfcontained modules. They are reusable.

# Function delcaration, docstring, and function body.

def example_function():
    """
    This is a docstring.
    It describes what the function does.
    """
    print("This is a function") # Function body
