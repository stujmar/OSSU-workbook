# What have we learned so far.

# For loops
# While loops
# Functions
# Iterations

# Now using strings to generate algorithms

# String are case sensitive
# Strings can be compared.

if "this" != "that":
    print("this is not that")

# Strings are ordered with indices
data = "<ooXoo>"
print(data[3], "marks the spot.")

# Strings are immutable


# range is a nice way to loop of numbers.
# for can also loop over strings

for index in range(len(data)):
    print(index, data[index])
# Cool.
