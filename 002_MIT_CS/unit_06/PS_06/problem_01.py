# Problem Set 6

# Problem 1-1
# The ONLY thing we are interested in when designing programs is that it returns the correct answer.
# False >>> False!

# Problem 1-2
# When determining asymptotic complexity, we discard all terms except for the one with the largest growth rate.
# True >>> True! You can ignore lower terms.

# Problem 1-3
# Bisection search is an example of linear time complexity.
# True >>> False! Because it isn't exponential. Apparently it isn't.

# Problem 1-4
# For large values of n, an algorithm that takes 20000n^2 steps has better time complexity (takes less time) than one that takes 0.001n^5 steps
# True
