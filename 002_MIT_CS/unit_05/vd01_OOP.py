# Object Oriented Programming

# Object has a type, state, and behavior
# Object is a type
# Object has a state internal data representation
# Object has a behavior

# Instances. 1 3 5 6 are instances of the class int
# "hello" is an instance of the class str

# Data abstraction is hiding the implementation details of the object
# you can delete objects either by del or by garbage collection

# Lists Tuples and Strings are built in objects.
# We'll look at those and make our own.

[1, 2, 3] # instance of list

# Linked lists each points to the next element or cell in memory.
# internal proceedures of an object should be private and only defined interfaces should be used.

# How do we make our own objects?
# We'll start with a class.

L = [1, 2, 3]

print(len(L))

# Bundle data into packages.

# inheritance is a way to share code between classes, via the use of a base class. and the derived class inherits all the methods and attributes of the base class.
