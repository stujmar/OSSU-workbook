# Problem 1-1

# In the statement L = [1,2,3], L is a class.
# L is a list. L is a variable. False, it is not a class.

# Problem 1-2

# A term is a combination of variables and constants. or variables and coefficients.
my_term = "2a"
# a polynomial is a combination of terms.

# Problem 1-3

# True the complexity of a binary search on a sorted list is O(log n).

# Problem 1-4

# True A bisection search algorithm always returns the correct answer when searching for an element in a sorted list.

# Problem 1-5

# False Performing binary search on an unsorted list will always return the correct answer in O(n) time. 
# On an unsorted list to get the correct answer, we need to sort the list, or we need to use a linear search algorithm.

# Problem 1-6
