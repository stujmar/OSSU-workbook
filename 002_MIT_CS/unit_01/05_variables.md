# Abstrations known as Variable assignments.

> use = to assign

```Python
pi = 3.14159
```

the value is bound to the word pi.

Why would we give names to values and expression.
1. you could store a vaue and not have to re-compute it
2. if the name is informative it can make the code more human readable
3. if you use the value throughout your program you could change it in just one spot
   

Swapping Varialbes
```Python
x=5
y=10
temp = y
y = x
x = temp
```
