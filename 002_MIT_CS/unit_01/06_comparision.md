# Comparision operators

Here are some 
- >
- <
- >=
- <=
- ==
- !=
- is is ===
- is not is !==
  
  and or to combine multiple comparisions

  A series of tests to create a branching program
  Conditionals.

  ```Python
    x = input('Enter an integer:')
    if x%2 == 0:
        print('Even')
    else:
        print('Odd')
  ```

You can next conditionals, you can also string them together with `elif` keyword 

```Python
    if this and that:
        print('do something')
    elif third_thing == True:
        print('Second thing to do')
    else:
        print('I guess it has come to this')
```
